Title : Computing the mean free path for the molecules of a gas

A gas molecule's mean free path Î» is its average path length
between collisions.

Let's look at the motion of a gas molecule inside an ideal 
gas; a typical molecule inside an ideal gas will abruptly 
change its direction and speed as it collides elastically with 
other molecules of the same gas. Though between the 
collisions, the molecule will move in a straight line at some 
constant speed, this is applicable for all the molecules in 
the gas.
